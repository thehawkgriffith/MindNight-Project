A creation of the game "MindNight" using python. 
The game is available for free on Steam.

**I do not own the game, nor am I sponsored to advertise it, 
however I am a big fan, and just wanted to recreate it out of curiosity.**

The game is about controversial social deduction.

I have made the standard match of 6 people with 4 agents and 2 hackers.

The agents need to secure 3/5 nodes in order to win, while the hackers need
to hack 3/5 nodes in order to win.

The agents do not know about other members present but the hackers do know about
each other, their primary objective is to trick agents into thinking they themselves
are agents and hack nodes, and the agent's job is to recongnise the hackers.

I recreated this game in Python so that I can develop Reinforcement Learning
agents to play the game as effectively as possible.

Work on the A.I. is currently under progress, until future updates.

State design of the model is ready.
Reward design of the model is ready.
These are probably prototypes, will test them out once the work is complete and trainable.
Currently working on the action function and RL Environement interface design.

If you do happen to take interest and fork it to improve it in any way, or 
have any idea you want to share/report a bug, please mail me.

version = 0.3.6 (beta)
